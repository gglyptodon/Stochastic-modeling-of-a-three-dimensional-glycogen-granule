# (ongoing) Stochastic modeling of a three dimensional glycogen granule

This repository contains jupyter notebook scripts to reproduce all the figures presented in the article "Stochastic modeling of a three-dimensional glycogen granule and impact of the branching enzyme on the structure"

Some functions will be re-defined in some scripts while there could be already define in the main class from `glycogen_module.py`. It allows some flexibility in the notebooks and the plots.

The parameters file `parameters.json`, is required to initiate a glycogen granule. Although most of the time prameters will be set inside the different scripts.

to add: 
- required packages
- description of 'glycogen_structure' object and methods
